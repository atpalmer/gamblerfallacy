# Martingale Gambling Strategy

The "Martingale" strategy ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system))) is a betting system under which the gambler doubles his bet when losing, thereby needing only the next win to get back to even.

This simulation applies a version of the strategy and tracks overall winnings, as well as highs, lows, and winning and losing streaks.


## Samples

The following sample runs use 1,000,000,000 iterations and a 10-dollar starting bet. The bet increases, as necessary, when losing, and returns to the initial bet when winning.
